![Use cases](Picture\Use_cases.PNG)

## **Main_motivation**
* Fast compilation of DLL-based LV executables (in case of big projects)
* Interoperability between programming languages
* Packed library „dependency hell“
  * Details: dependency conflict across CTF.lvlibp, simulations lvlibps and CORE.lvlibp --> runtime error in application!

## **LV usage issues**

1.  Inheritance from .NET class is not possible --> CTSWPL core‘s „plugin“ interfaces not usable (limited workaround exists)

2.  Parent class’ (public) methods not visible --> Code duplication of CTSWPL core’s in CTSWPL core API (workaround exists)

3.  Can´t abort .NET calls externally --> Abort functionality (watchdogs) must be wrapped, e.g., in CTSWPL core API (limited workaround exists)

4.  DLL call returns default values in case of exception --> Functional limitation in general (workaround exists)

5.  Can´t export methods from packed library --> CTF member methods can’t be exported (limited workaround exists)

6.  Other issues: constructor, non-primitive output types

## **VS_usage__Issues**

1.  Inheritance from .NET class is not possible --> CTSWPL core‘s „plugin“ interfaces not usable (limited workaround exists) Works in VS but: Overwrite of .NET class member method is not possible --> Plugin implementation functionality is limited (limited workaround exists)
NOTE: it’s an improvement compared to LV usage (inheritance can be handled)

2.  Parent class’ (public) methods not visible --> Code duplication of CTSWPL core’s in CTSWPL core API (workaround exists) Works in VS

3.  Can´t abort .NET calls externally --> Abort functionality (watchdogs) must be wrapped, e.g., in CTSWPL core API (limited workaround exists) Not tried but should work (watchdog thread etc.)

4.  DLL call returns default values in case of exception --> Functional limitation in general (workaround exists) Should be the same in LV and VS, not fully tested in VS

5.  Can´t export methods from packed library --> CTF member methods can’t be exported (limited workaround exists) Applies here as well

6.  Other issues: constructor, non-primitive output types Applies here as well
	New issue: array output types (only in VS 2015)
